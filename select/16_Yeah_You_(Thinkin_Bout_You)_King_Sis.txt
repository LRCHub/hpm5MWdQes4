Yeah, you
You always made me feel like home
Yeah, you
You never leave my thoughts alone
Yeah, you
You're the reason I'm going out my mind
I just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you

Take it away, take it away
Feeling too good to me
Chillin' all day, all in your space
Is where I wanna be
Here in this room
What did you do?
I just can't get enough
Too caught up in your love

I've been trying to forget
But you won't let me
Something in my brain wants you
I've been hanging by myself
Asking for help
But nothing seems to work on you

Yeah, you
You always made me feel like home
Yeah, you
You never leave my thoughts alone
Yeah, you
You're the reason I'm going out my mind

(I just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you)
(Can't stop thinkin' 'bout you)
(I just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you)

All that I crave when you're away
Nights are sleepless
Do we need space, yeah, maybe a break
Boy you're my weakness
Give and we take
The love that we make
It's my favorite drug
Too caught up in your love

I've been trying to forget
But you won't let me
Something in my brain wants you
I've been hanging by myself
Asking for help
But nothing seems to work on you

Yeah, you
You always made me feel like home
Yeah, you
You never leave my thoughts alone
Yeah, you
You're the reason I'm going out my mind
I just can't stop thinkin' 'bout-

Yeah, you
You always made me feel like home
Yeah, you
You never leave my thoughts alone
Yeah, you
You're the reason I'm going out my mind
I just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you

(I just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you)
(Can't stop thinkin' 'bout you)
(I just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you)
(I just can't stop 'bout you)
