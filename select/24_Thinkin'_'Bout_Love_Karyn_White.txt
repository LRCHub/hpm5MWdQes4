Thinkin' about your love.
And it feels so good.
Thinkin' 'bout love
I been tearin' up daisies all afternoon.
Does he love me or not, am I asking too soon?
When the phone rings I answer hoping it's you.
No I don't want to sound desperate but if I do,
Don't judge me if what I say sounds funny cause
I'm thinkin' 'bout love.
Each night I hold my pillow tight.
