[00:18.36] I like to think about the time I met you
[00:22.58] Living with your people down in New Orleans
[00:26.27] Mad at your mama cause she'd never let you
[00:30.26] Ride in no nasty limousine
[00:34.18] Later on the levee with the moon up above
[00:38.56] I lost my heart and confessed my love
[00:42.42] Oh Lucy, God have mercy
[00:46.31] I've got to stop thinkin' 'bout that
[01:04.31] 
[01:08.25] One Summer night in a field of wheat
[01:12.44] God's sweet lanterns hanging in the sky
[01:17.39] Moving light on your tiny feet
[01:20.95] I knew I had to love you till the day I die
[01:25.79] They talk about Amazing Grace
[01:29.52] It meant something when I saw your face
[01:33.08] Oh Lucy, God have mercy
[01:37.13] I've got to stop thinkin' 'bout that
[01:55.13] 
[01:48.88] I think of all the little things that I never told you
[01:53.45] I think I may get to hold you someday
[01:57.53] It's in my brain just like a man possessed
[02:00.77] I can't do me no work, I can't get me no rest
[02:05.27] I can't understand it baby
[02:18.27] 
[02:27.46] Don't like to think about the way it ended
[02:31.47] I hate remembering the things that I said
[02:35.56] I dream a dream of love so splendid
[02:39.45] I wake up hard in an empty bed
[02:43.56] I wonder who'll be loving you next
[02:47.42] Some fool will be writing bad checks
[02:51.49] Oh now Lucy, God have mercy
[02:55.43] I've got to stop thinkin' 'bout you
