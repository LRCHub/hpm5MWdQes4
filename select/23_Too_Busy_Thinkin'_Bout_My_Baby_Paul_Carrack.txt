I ain't got time to think about money or what it can buy
And I ain't got time to sit down and wonder at what make the birdies fly.
I don't have time to think about what makes the flowers grow,
Ain't never give it a thought to where the rivers flow.
Ain't got time for nothin' else.
I ain't got time to discuss the weather, or know what's going on,
And I ain't got time to do no studying once I get out of class.
And I'm just a fellow with a one track mind, and when it comes to thinkin'
About anything but my baby, I just don't have time.
Ain't got time for nothin' else.
I ain't got time to read a newspaper or look at T.V.
'Cause I'm not concerned with what the future holds in store for me.
I'm just a fellow with a one track mind, and when it comes to thinkin'
About
Anything but my baby, I just don't have time.
