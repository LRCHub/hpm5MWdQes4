Though we push this feeling aside
And though we cry, this can't go on forever
Seasons come and seasons flow and I know
That most things come to an end
But you're so wonderful
Good for me in every way
And I love that message you left on my
Service today

"Oh, boy I'm thinkin' 'bout you"
Girl, I'm thinkin' about you, too
You've become so special, someone I don't
Want to lose

"Baby boy I'm thinkin' 'bout you, your love"
I need you in my life

Sometimes the simple things are the best
Things to say
And sometimes it's what you least expect
That will make your day
And sometimes it's not words at all but a
Glance saying "I'm okay"
Sometimes a simple "Hi, it's me" will set
You on your way
Like a warm breeze
A memory that stays in your head
One that feels so good you'll wish you could
Live itinstead

"Oh, boy I'm thinkin' 'bout you"
Girl, I'm dreamin' about you, too
You're so spesial, somene, the only one
I choose

"Baby boy I'm thinkin' 'bout you, your love"
I need you in my life

Never say no, 'cause what you won't do
You do for love, no matter what they say
You'll swalow your pride
Reach down deep inside
And find what is true and what's real
Baby, ooh I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Yes, I'm thinkin' 'bout you, your love
I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Baby, ooh I'm thinkin' 'bout you, your love
