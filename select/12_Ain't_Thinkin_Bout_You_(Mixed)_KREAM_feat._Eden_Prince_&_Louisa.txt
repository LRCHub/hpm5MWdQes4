I think I need something different
I'm sick and tired of you
You don't know what you're missing
But I got nothing to lose
And all those times you said
That you're better off with someone else
I hope you find what you need
Leave me in your past, there's no point in turning back
When you kiss her and pretend that it's me
I ain't thinkin' 'bout you anymore
What if you did the same and just let go
Don't care about you, not at all
'Cause I know that my feelings are long gone
I ain't thinkin' 'bout you anymore
What if you did the same and just let go
Don't care about you, not at all
'Cause I know that my feelings are long gone
I'm doing pretty good on my own
And you look ridiculous all alone
Ain't thinkin' 'bout you anymore
Guess it hurts I'm all good and you're fucked up
And when I find someone different
It won't be nothing like us
You think you're one in a million
To me you're nothing at all
And all those times you said
That you're better off with someone else
I hope you find what you need
Leave me in your past, there's no point in turning back
When you kiss her and pretend that it's me
I ain't thinkin' 'bout you anymore
What if you did the same and just let go
Don't care about you, not at all
'Cause I know that my feelings are long gone
I ain't thinkin' 'bout you anymore
What if you did the same and just let go
Don't care about you, not at all
'Cause I know that my feelings are long gone
I'm doing pretty good on my own
And you look ridiculous all alone
Ain't thinkin' 'bout you anymore
Guess it hurts I'm all good and you're fucked up
